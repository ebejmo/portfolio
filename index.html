          <h3>about</h3>
          <p>
            My name is Emil Bejmo, I am 33 year old Swede currently living in
            Oslo, Norway and I am a front-end development student at Noroff. I
            am passionate about creating user-friendly and visually appealing
            applications. As I continue to learn more and more about the field,
            my goal is to enhance my skills and become proficient in my craft.
          </p>
          <p class="p-second">
            Apart from school work, I have also been playing professional hockey
            since the age of 18, which amounts to 15 years of experience on the
            ice. It has taught me discipline, teamwork, and the importance of
            dedication.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I pursue my education, my primary objective is to absorb as much
            knowledge as possible in order to secure a rewarding front-end
            position in the future. In addition to my academic and sporting
            endeavors, I am also a proud father to a newborn daughter. During my
            free time, I enjoy playing golf.

              <p>
                The task for this project was to create a blog site, design and
                topics on the blog was chosen by myself. Content is fetched from
                a headless WordPress CMS and pages are dynamically created based
                on what link the user has clicked.
              </p>
              <p>
                Is the content on the site amazing? Absolutely not. But the site
                is looks good on diffrent screen sizes and is inutivie and user
                friendly. On the homepage there is a sweet carousel that
                displays all the blogposts and on the blog page there is a "Show
                More" button that does what it supposed to do. Since I am just
                getting strated with learning JavaScript this project was by far
                the most challenging to date but also where I have learned the
                most.

                Semester projects for the first semester. The goal was to design
                a prototype and later build a site for a science museum that
                would appeal to its target audience, middle school children and
                its parents. The site is user friendly, responsive and easy to
                navigate on a variety of devices.

                This project started with designing a prototype in Adobe XD for
                a clothing company that sells rain jackets online. Over time I
                have built upon the project, taking the prototype to a live site
                on the web built with basic HTML and CSS to dynamically create
                pages with JavaScript. Content managment and fetch products with
                WordPress REST API. Currently the site is under construction
                where it lacks a working 'add to cart' function.
